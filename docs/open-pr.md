# Opening a pull request (without GitHub CLI)

1. **Push your branch**, then open the "Compare & pull request" link from the terminal output, or go to the repo on GitHub and click **Pull requests → New pull request**. Choose your branch vs `main`.

2. **Title:** Use a clear, descriptive title (e.g. `Add Real-Time Threat Monitor dashboard`, `Rebrand UI to Hyper Watch`).

3. **Description:** If the repo has a [PR template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md), it will appear automatically. Fill it in. Otherwise paste your summary, context, and checklist.

4. **After creating the PR:** Add labels and assign reviewers in the GitHub UI if your team uses them.
